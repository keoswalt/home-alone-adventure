# Home Alone: The Remix

This is a choose-your-own adventure site I created as an assignment for RISD's interactive design program in December 2023. The story is based on the classic holiday film [Home Alone](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099785/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) and gives users the opportunity to see what might have happened if Kevin McCallister's mom had made some different choices.

## How to Use

The story has eight decision points (each with two possible paths forward) and six potential endings. You can navigate back one step at any point, or—if you don't feel like choosing for yourself—use the automatic "move forward" option to have the site choose for you.

## Technology

This is a basic HTML site with 15 pages and one CSS style sheet. As of December 2023, it only exists in a desktop version.
